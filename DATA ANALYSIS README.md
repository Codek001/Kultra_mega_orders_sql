## üîç Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### 1. **Dropped Unnecessary Column**

* `product_name` was removed due to redundancy or lack of analytical relevance.

### 2. **Handling Missing Values**

* `Product_Base_Margin`: 63 blanks replaced with `0`.
* Then replaced all `0` entries with the **mean value** of non-zero margins (0.51).

### 3. **Date Type Conversion**

* `Order_Date` and `Ship_Date` were cleaned and converted to `DATE` format for accurate temporal analysis.

### 4. **Standardizing Categorical Variables**

* Null or blank entries in `Order_Priority` were replaced with `'Not Specified'`.
